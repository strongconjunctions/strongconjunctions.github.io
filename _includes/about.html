  	<p><strong class="highlight">I am a UI/UX designer</strong>. Most of the things I make are user oriented. This means that my design process is geared towards a specific client, and a specific purpose. Design for me is first and foremost about <strong>functionality</strong> at every level: at the level of performance, functionality, code readability, ease of access, and visual simplicity. I therefore view myself as someone heavily invested in such design features as <strong>organization</strong>, <strong>planning</strong>, and <strong>taxonomies</strong>. Design is also effective information distribution, hence any highly organized and efficient system is always a good designed and beautiful system. I also strongly believe that any high order of organization is inherently beautiful, as it lacks any unnecessary parts.
